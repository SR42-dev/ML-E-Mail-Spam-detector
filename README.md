# ML-E-Mail-Spam-detector
An e-mail spam detection project to learn the basics of ML

Notes :

- Downloading email data from the internet as I have no spam in my inbox and the few that I do have contain a single image with no text

- Dataset link : https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Playing-with-datasets/blob/master/Email%20Spam%20Filtering/emails.csv

- predict function will not work without access to the lineSpace & getUsableText functions

- First execution will take more time than subsequent ones
